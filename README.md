### 🤙 Hello there!

This is my project called **Smart Gallery** ✨

#

### 🔎 About this project

I've decided to create this to better organize some image folders that I have on my PC since the beggining of time. By "organize" I mean:

- Create categories of images and group them if needed
- Upload/Edit images, adding some informations about it (such as "name" or "description")


#### 👓 What am I using in this?

For the **front-end** I've decided to stick with Vue CLI + Vuetify + SASS

<a target="_blank" href="https://sass-lang.com/"><img alt="sass logo" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Sass-CC6699?style=for-the-badge&logo=sass&logoColor=white" /></a>

As for the **back-end** I've created an REST API with Laravel/Lumen in PHP

At last, for the **database** I've decided to use a MySQL database
